# Market Sentiment and Trader Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between cryptocurrency trader behavior and market sentiment, focusing on the Bitcoin market. Using the Fear and Greed Index as a key sentiment indicator, we explore how trader profitability, risk-taking, volume, and leverage vary across different sentiment phases.

## Objectives

- Analyze how trader metrics such as profitability, risk exposure, trade volume, and leverage usage correlate with market sentiment.
- Identify whether trader actions align with or oppose prevailing Fear or Greed market phases.
- Uncover patterns and signals to guide more informed and disciplined trading decisions.
- Develop insights to support smarter, sentiment-aware trading strategies.

## Data

- **Market Sentiment Data:** Daily Fear and Greed classifications capturing market mood dynamics.
- **Trader Transaction Data:** Detailed trade logs including profit/loss (PnL), leverage, trade size, and timestamps.

## Methodology

- Cleaned and preprocessed datasets for quality and consistency.
- Aligned timestamps to merge trade data with corresponding daily sentiment.
- Aggregated trader metrics by sentiment classification to calculate average closed PnL, total trade volume, and leverage patterns.
- Filtered out anomalies and normalized data for fair comparisons.
- Used statistical summaries, visualizations, and time-series analysis to explore relationships between trader performance and market sentiment.

## Key Insights

- Trader profitability is generally higher during fearful market phases compared to greedy phases.
- Contrarian strategies—being cautious during greed and opportunistic during fear—tend to improve trading outcomes.
- Extreme sentiment periods amplify risk and reward dynamics.
- Timing matters: certain days and months show better trading performance.
- Incorporating sentiment indices alongside traditional indicators enhances decision-making.
- Continuous monitoring and adaptation are essential due to evolving sentiment-driven trading behavior.

## Usage
